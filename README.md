#### Game's Objective

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player strategy game where the objective is for one player to align three of their symbols (either "X" or "O") in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on a 3x3 grid, before their opponent does. The game ends when one player achieves this alignment or when all grid spaces are filled without either player achieving a winning line, resulting in a draw.

#### Rules

1. Game Board: The game is played on a 3x3 grid or board.
2. Players: There are two players in the game. One player is "X" and the other is "O".
3. Starting the Game: Players decide who goes first, often with a simple method like "rock, paper, scissors". Traditionally, "X" goes first.
4. Making a Move: On a player's turn, they place their chosen symbol ("X" or "O") on any empty square on the board.

#### Game Mechanics

While this game follows a traditional Tic-Tac-Toe game, I will be adding additional custom interactions as per the assignment requirement, some ideas I have as to what features I would add...

1. Custom animations when placing symbol
2. Hover effects on empty squares to show where a player can place their symbol
3. Scoreboard to keep track of the number of wins, losses and ties for both players during their session
4. Timed turns

Not all of these will be implemented but these are some ideas I have to implement more interactivity within my game
