// Save refs to the DOM Nodes, grab tile information using document.querySelector



//Initialize variables to control the game (ex. board, current player, win status, etc.)



//Hard code i.e. identify the positions of each board



//Add utility functions for checking win condtions, some utility functions for example

    /* 
        - check if player action is valid, i.e. is the tile taken or not
        - check for a win condition, meaning did a player get a three in a row/col?
        - change player
        - announce who won
    */

//create a function to handle result validation


//create function to handle user action

//create a method to handle the reset of the board

//handle logic for custom game components

/* 
    - for the assignment specs, we need to create atleast 2-3 custom interactions, for this game I am thinking of adding custom buttons which changes the gameplay mechanic
      (ex. not set in stone but maybe by clicking one button, it removes a the input from any random tile consuming a players turn but can be used as a gamble mechanic to perhaps
        prevent a user from getting a three in a row)
